This project requires the following plugins which are not checked in into VCS:

- Modalbox plugin
- RichUI plugin
- Feeds plugin
- Avatar plugin (0.1 currently)

After fresh checkout from VCS, run the following commands to install the above mentioned plugins:

'grails upgrade'
'grails install-plugin modalbox'
'grails install-plugin richui'
'grails install-plugin http://avatargrailsplugin.googlecode.com/files/grails-avatar-plugin-0.1.zip'

=== Modalbox plugin notes
If the current installed version of Modalbox plugin is 0.2, after installing it, replace the  ModalboxTagLib.groovy with the modified version from src/etc, as the original 0.2 version of this taglib has few bugs:

'cp src/etc/ModalboxTagLib.groovy plugins/modalbox-0.2/grails-app/taglib/'

=== Avatar plugin notes
If the current installed version of Avatar plugin is 0.1, after installing it, replace the AvatarTagLib.groovy with the modified version from src/etc, as the original 0.1 version of this taglib lacks some features which Grails Crowd uses

'cp src/etc/AvatarTagLib.groovy plugins/avatar-plugin-0.1/grails-app/taglib/'
