- Url based
add any url and required roles to "requestMapString" in "grails-app/conf/SecurityConfig"

- Controller based
extend the SecureController and add a beforeInterceptor calling the "auth" method.
As default "ROLE_USER" is required but can be changed by the "requestAllowed" attribute.

- Changes in the model
members are "enabled" and have hard coded "ROLE_USER" as default authority. this may be changed
to a more fexible authority system with additional roles.
